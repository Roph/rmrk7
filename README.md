RMRK.net SMF Theme, 7th Edition

To install on an SMF forum, you must create a .zip of the theme's root files. The .zip that github gives you (https://github.com/Roph/rmrk7/archive/master.zip) creates an additional sub-folder.

Note what whatever you name the .zip will reflect the theme's directory in your SMF installation. After initial install, simply upload any newer revisions, overwriting your current rmrk7 theme to update.
